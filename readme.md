You have been given a gift card that is about to expire and you want to buy
gifts for 2 friends. You want to spend the whole gift card, or if thatâ€™s not an
option as close to it as possible. You have a list of sorted prices for a
popular store that you know they both like to shop at. Your task is to find
two distinct items in the list whose sum is minimally under (or equal to) the
gift card balance.
